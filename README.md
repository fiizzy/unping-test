# unping_test

A new Flutter project.

### Performance Optimization

- Followed the Single responsibility principle allowing one class to be concerned with only one entity
- Implemented DRY principle that naturally made my code reusable [ reusable widgets]

### What I would do differently

- Use more abstract classes to enforce consistency in some reusable widgets

### Architecture used:

I used the MVC [ layer first approach ] architecture mostly because of the project size and scope. This avoids a considerable amount of boiler plates, and keeps everything simple.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
